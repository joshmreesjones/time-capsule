# What this is?
This is a small content management system for websites.

# Glossary
- Content writer: the web-facing interface for authors to write their web content in Markdown
- Article: one piece of web content
- News feed: a compact list of articles written by authors

# Process
1. Web authors write an article on the website and submit it.
2. The article and metadata are stored somewhere.
3. When the news feed is requested from the web server, it is retreived and returned to the client

# Dependencies
- (Python 3)[https://www.python.org/]
- (bottle.py)[http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/index.html]
- `insert Markdown compiler here`

# Wait a second...
Hopefully you're thinking to yourself:

> Wait a second, this has been done before!

Why yes, it has. I'm just making this to learn.
