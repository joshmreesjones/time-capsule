				This is a list of heads of state, government leaders, and other rulers in the year 198 BC. The column "Title" refers to being of the state in question (e.g. "Emperor" under the heading "Japan" means "Emperor of Japan") unless otherwise stated. Kurt-Friedrich Gänzl (born 15 February 1946) is a writer, musicologist, casting director and singer best known for his books about musical theatre. After a decade-long acting and singing career and a second career as a casting director of West End shows, Gänzl has become one of the world's most important chroniclers of the history of musical theatre.
			</p>

			<p>
				Gänzl was born Brian Roy Gallas in Wellington, New Zealand and is of Austrian descent, the son of Frederick, né Fritz Eduard Gänzl, an educator, and Nancy Gallas, née Agnes Ada Welsh. He studied law and classics at University of Canterbury in New Zealand, receiving a masters degree in 1967 while performing as a radio and concert vocalist. Early in his career, Gänzl wrote plays. His one-act plays Elektra and The Women of Troy were produced in New Zealand in 1966 and 1967 by Elmwood Players.
			</p>

			<p>
				While still working as a casting director, Gänzl began writing theatre reference works. In 1986 he published his two-volume history, The British Musical Theatre (Macmillan Press, 1986), which won the Roger Machell Prize for the year's best performing-arts book and the British Library Association's McColvin Medal for the outstanding reference work (any subject) of its season. This was followed by Gänzl's Book of the Musical Theatre (1988 with Andrew Lamb), The Blackwell Guide to the Musical Theater on Record (1989), The Complete 'Aspects of Love' (1990), five editions of Musicals (1995; US: Song and Dance: The Complete Story of Stage Musicals), and The Musical: A Concise History (1997).
			</p>

			<p>
				Gänzl's seminal reference work, The Encyclopedia of the Musical Theatre, was published in 1994 and greatly expanded in a second edition in 2001. It was a Dartmouth Medal honoree in 1995 and was awarded "Outstanding Reference Source" in 1997 by the American Library Association. Theatre historian John Kenrick describes it as follows: "Only serious research libraries carry this set listing thousands of shows and individuals. This expanded update of the 1995 original edition is the best source to date on European musicals, with solid coverage of Broadway too.
			</p>

			<p>
				The Times wrote, "So, with The Encyclopaedia of the Musical Theatre, Kurt Ganzl... has transcended all rivals. His work embraces not only Broadway and Shaftesbury Avenue, but Vienna and Budapest, Paris and Rome, Sydney and Toronto. He even apologises for including only three New Zealand entries. If there is a musical production of any kind that he does not know about, then it is odds-on that nobody else does either." Gänzl has said, "My goals are to make the musical theater a respectable academic subject and to put the musical theater into its international context.
