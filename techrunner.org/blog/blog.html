				Over the last few days, I have been adding structure and content to the site's pages. I have not added any style with CSS or anything, and I haven't validated the XHTML, so the site doesn't have any visual appeal yet. I plan on making a simple logo in Photoshop and a few simple graphics to go with the color scheme I have yet to choose, but nothing special as of yet. I do not know much about Photoshop yet, so I won't be making any of my own web graphics past this level until I get <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Photoshop-CS5-The-Missing-Manual/dp/1449381685/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1337640894&sr=8-1" title="Buy the book on Amazon.com">Photoshop: The Missing Manual</a>. Right now, the plan is to simply finish adding content and then adding some simple styles with CSS (nothing fancy), putting a few graphics in, and then continuing with my HTML book (and hopefully with more HTML and CSS books in the future). As a new web developer, I anticipate learning a lot about the workflow of writing HTML, XHTML, and CSS from scratch and could switch to a WYSIWYG editor such as Dreamweaver of SharePoint Designer. I also anticipate learning a lot more about advanced web construction due to the fact that I have not reached those chapters in the book I am reading.

				Thanks for reading my very first blog post! I hope it wasn't too dull and boring. Take care!
