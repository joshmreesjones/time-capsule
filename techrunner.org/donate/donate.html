			<h2>Relax - you don't have to give up your money just yet!</h2>
			<p>
				I will not be providing a Donate link until later on. Why will I be asking for donations? Read on...
			</p>
			
			<h2>Why donate?</h2>
			<p>
				Software is not free. Books to learn the software can add up. Computer upgrades to run the software are expensive. Hosting a website is usually a monthly or tri-monthly expense. Donations from people like you will:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Keep TechRunner up and running</li>
				<li>Help me buy books, software, and computer parts</li>
				<li>Give content writers like me more knowledge to give you the best tutorials possible</li>
				<li>Expand the range of articles and tutorials to new areas</li>
				<li>Make you feel warm inside</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				No money collected from donating web surfers will be used in any way other than advancing the website and its content. In addition, a list of donors will be maintained on this page and each donor will get a small page of their own, unless a donor requests to be anonymous and/or does not want a page.
