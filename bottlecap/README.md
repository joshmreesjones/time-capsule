Overview
========
Bottlecap is a web framework for developers to use as scaffolding for their
website. It gives developers tools to create static and dynamic pages (with
templates) and web interfaces to create, delete, and modify formatted content.
Bottlecap is meant to be a scaffolding on which to build full-featured websites.
It is meant to be simple, be easy to set up, reduce duplication in static site
code, simplify and speed up the website creation process, and be accommodating
to developers making simple websites both for themselves and for non-developers,
all with a small footprint.
